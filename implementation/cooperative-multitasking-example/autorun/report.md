# Report

This file contains reports for programs of `02-program-loader.py`.

### reactorctl.py

With the default configuration, this program doesn't blow up Chernobyl. This may change based on system performance.

### sum.py

With the default configuration, it takes much longer to finish the sum than if it just does it all at once, but at least it doesn't blow Chernobyl.
