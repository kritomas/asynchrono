# Programs for Cooperative Scheduler

This is where you should put scripts to be executed by the cooperative scheduler. A few examples are provided by default:

### reactorctl.py

This is the control program for Chernobyl. It must get control from the scheduler every once in a while, or else the reactor explodes.

### sum.py

This sums up and prints a large set of numbers. It is written so that it yields every few iterations, in order to save Chernobyl. The numbers must first be generated by `../generate-numbers.py`.

# Configuration

These default examples can be configured by `../config.json`:

+	`num_gen.total` - The total amount of numbers generated by `../generate-numbers.py`.
+	`sum.yield_every` - After how many iterations should `sum.py` yield, in an attempt to save Chernobyl.
+	`reactorctl.stabilisation_time` - How long it takes to stabilize Chernobyl, in seconds.
+	`reactorctl.stabilisation_interval` - The maximum amount of time `reactorctl.py` is allowed to wait, in seconds. **If it takes longer than this to give it control, the reactor explodes.**
